# Flowgramming

![Home](images/home.png)

**Flowgramming** is a platform-independent graphical authoring tool which allows users
to draw and execute programs using flowcharts.

**Why Flowgramming?**

For the novice programmer, it is usually difficult to de-link the programming logic from the syntax of the programming language. This often leads to students memorizing code rather than understanding the logic and designing solutions. Flowgramming was built in an effort for beginner and novice programmers to understand programming logic and develop algorithmic thinking & problem solving skills without the hassle of learning the code syntax.

This site serves as an user manual on how to use the Flowgramming web application.
